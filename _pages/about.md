<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I’m **Eliza Yiting Tang**, an undergraduate at the University of Sydney majoring in **Econometrics and Software Development**, currently applying for PhD programs in **Quantitative Marketing**, **Information Systems**, and **Algorithmic Behavioral Modeling**.

My research explores how individuals learn and respond to algorithmic recommendations over time, with applications in both **digital platforms** and **sustainable mobility ecosystems**. I am particularly interested in **preference externalities**, **delayed exposure**, and **causal learning** mechanisms that shape long-term platform behavior.

I’ve independently led several working papers that focus on:
- **Preference Externalities in Sustainable Product Pricing**
- **Causal Modeling of Retention under LLM-based Interventions**
- **EvoNet**: An expressive neural architecture for adaptive path control
- **Adoption Mechanism Design for Green eVTOL Platforms**

Beyond research, I am the co-founder of **YITA AVIATION**, a startup advancing urban air mobility technologies. I also actively participate in sustainability dialogues and was invited to the **UN Sustainable Development Goals Dinner (Australia, Nov 2024)**.

I’m currently preparing submissions to **AAAI**, **INFORMS**, and **NeurIPS workshops**, and welcome collaborations in **user modeling**, **algorithmic experimentation**, and **platform incentive design**.
