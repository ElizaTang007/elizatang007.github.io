<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I‚Äôm **Eliza Yiting Tang**, an undergraduate at the University of Sydney majoring in **Econometrics and Software Development**, currently applying for PhD programs in **Quantitative Marketing**, **Information Systems**, and **Algorithmic Behavioral Modeling**.

My research explores how individuals learn and respond to algorithmic recommendations over time, with applications in both **digital platforms** and **sustainable mobility ecosystems**. I am particularly interested in **preference externalities**, **delayed exposure**, and **causal learning** mechanisms that shape long-term platform behavior.

I‚Äôve independently led several working papers that focus on:
- **Preference Externalities in Sustainable Product Pricing**
- **Causal Modeling of Retention under LLM-based Interventions**
- **EvoNet**: An expressive neural architecture for adaptive path control
- **Adoption Mechanism Design for Green eVTOL Platforms**

I co-founded [**YITA AVIATION**](https://yita-aviation.com), a research-driven startup shaping the future of urban air mobility (UAM) by integrating eVTOL system design, algorithmic platform modeling, and policy simulation. Our work engages with academic institutions and regulatory think tanks to build scalable mobility solutions rooted in economic and infrastructural realism.

I‚Äôm currently preparing submissions to **AAAI**, **INFORMS**, and **NeurIPS workshops**, and welcome collaborations in **user modeling**, **algorithmic experimentation**, and **platform incentive design**.
