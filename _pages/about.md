<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I’m **Eliza Yiting Tang**, a final-year undergraduate at the University of Sydney, majoring in **Econometrics and Software Development**. My research lies at the intersection of **quantitative marketing**, **algorithm design**, and **urban air mobility (eVTOL)**. I am passionate about understanding how timing and structure of algorithmic exposure affects user behavior, retention, and societal adoption.

I have authored several working papers on:
- Causal modeling of LLM-based user retention
- Expressive neural network architecture (EvoNet)
- Green platform adoption under preference externalities
- AI education and timing-based simulation experiments

I am also the co-founder of **YITA AVIATION**, where I lead efforts to design scalable eVTOL systems for future cities.
